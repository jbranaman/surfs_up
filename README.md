## Summary

### Additional Data Queries for June and December
Two additional queries were created and run for data in June and December for temperature calculations at the most active station and precipitation summary statistics across all stations. The station query was chosen in order examine the most active area having the greatest number of recordings to test the reliability of the overall data calculations.

It can be determined that the overall data is fairly reliable with the temperature deviating from the overall low, high and average temperatures by only a few degrees.

The precipitation query was chosen in order to provide additional data points in the trends beyond just temperature. Below are the precipitation summary statistics across all stations for June and December.
